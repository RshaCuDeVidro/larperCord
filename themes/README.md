# Writing themes

**English** · [Português](README.pt-BR.md)

A larperCord theme is a [KDL](https://kdl.dev) file that describes **the whole interface**:
colors, fonts, styles and the layout tree. You can change the position of everything without writing
a line of code.

Put the file, for example `meu-tema.kdl`, in your themes folder:

| System | Folder |
|---|---|
| Linux | `~/.config/larpercord/themes/` (or `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/larpercord/themes/` when that variable is set) |
| Windows | `%APPDATA%\larpercord\themes\`, usually `C:\Users\<you>\AppData\Roaming\larpercord\themes\`. To open it, paste `%APPDATA%\larpercord` in File Explorer's address bar |

You can also use `themes/` when running from inside the repository. The app watches the theme folders that
exist when it opens. If you just created the folder, restart larperCord once: Settings → Updates →
**Restart larperCord**. Closing the window doesn't count, because by default it only hides the app in the tray.
**From then on, saving the file reloads the app right away.** If there's an error, a notice shows
`file:line:column` and the previous theme stays in effect.

Save the file as UTF-8. On Windows, Notepad's "UTF-8" is right. Don't use "UTF-16" ("Unicode"), which is
also what `>` writes in Windows PowerShell 5.1: the theme won't load and you get a syntax error. "UTF-8 with
BOM" (what `Set-Content -Encoding UTF8` writes in Windows PowerShell 5.1) puts three invisible bytes at the
start, and the app reads them as part of the first line. That does no harm when the file starts with a
comment, like the built-in themes, but if it starts with `theme`, `palette` or `colors`, that line is ignored.

Switch themes with `F2`, from the palette (`Ctrl+K` → "theme: …") or in Settings → Appearance.

Prefer clicking to typing? The [theme builder](https://rshacudevidro.github.io/larperCord/theme-builder.html) on the site
starts from any built-in theme, edits colors, fonts and layout with a live preview, checks contrast and gives you the `.kdl`.
It can also take the colors of a BetterDiscord or Vencord theme. Themes other people made are in the
[community gallery](https://rshacudevidro.github.io/larperCord/community-themes.html), and
[Sharing your theme](#sharing-your-theme) explains how to add yours.

## Minimal example

```kdl
theme "meu-tema" description="Servidores embaixo, chat em cima." preview=classic
palette "wal"                      // uses pywal colors (optional)

colors {
    accent "wal:4"
    surface "mix(wal:0, black, 0.2)"
}

layout {
    column {
        row flex=1 {
            channel-list width=240 bg=sidebar
            column flex=1 {
                messages flex=1
                composer height=46 inset-x=16 inset-y=4
            }
        }
        guild-bar height=60 orientation=horizontal
    }
}
```

## Top-level nodes

| Node | What it does |
|---|---|
| `theme "name" description=… author=… preview=…` | metadata. `preview` picks the thumbnail in settings: `classic`, `glass`, `terminal`, `bubbles`, `zen`, `mirror`, `office`, `desktop` |
| `palette "wal"` or `palette "#hex" …` | the 16 base colors (`wal:0` … `wal:15`). Without it, a default palette is used |
| `colors { token "expression" … }` | overrides color tokens (list below) |
| `roles "color" …` | up to 8 role colors (usernames, server icons) |
| `fonts ui="Inter" mono="JetBrains Mono" size=16` | families and base size. On Linux fontconfig resolves them; on Windows see [Fonts on Windows](#fonts-on-windows) |
| `metrics radius=6` | default rounding of rows and buttons |
| `window transparent=#true` | transparent window background. On Linux your compositor (Hyprland, KDE…) can blur what's behind it. On Windows the app doesn't ask the system for blur, so there's none |
| `styles { style "name" … }` | named styles to use with `style=name` |
| `layout { … }` | the interface tree (a single child at the root) |

`palette "wal"` reads pywal's 16 colors from `~/.cache/wal/colors` (always under `$HOME`, even when
`XDG_CACHE_HOME` is set). On Linux the app also watches that file, so the theme follows your wallpaper. On
Windows it only looks there when the `HOME` variable is set (`%HOME%\.cache\wal\colors`; pywal on Windows writes
to `%USERPROFILE%\.cache\wal`). It doesn't watch the file there: new colors show up the next time a theme file is
saved or the app opens. Without the file, the default palette is used. To set `HOME` on Windows, in PowerShell:
`[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable('HOME', $env:USERPROFILE, 'User')`. Then quit larperCord (**Quit** in the
tray icon's menu) and open it again from the Start menu.

## Colors

Expressions accepted anywhere a color is asked for:

```
"#df68ad"   "#df68ad80"   "#fff"   "#fff8"
"wal:4"                    palette color
"@surface"                 another token (already defined)
"mix(a, b, 0.3)"           blend
"alpha(a, 0.5)"            transparency
"lighten(a, 0.1)"  "darken(a, 0.2)"
white  black  transparent
```

Tokens: `bg` `rail` `sidebar` `surface` `elevated` `overlay` `text` `muted` `faint` `accent`
`accent-text` `border` `hover` `selected` `online` `idle` `dnd` `danger` `mention` `link`
`code-bg` `bubble-self` `bubble-self-text` `bubble-other` `shadow`.

## Styles

```kdl
styles {
    style "card" bg="@surface" radius=18 border="@border" border-width=1.5 glow="@accent" shadow=16
}
```

`glow` is the border color when the mouse is over it. `shadow` is the shadow size.
For a plain background with no named style, use it directly on the node: `bg=sidebar radius=12`
(`bg` on the node also accepts an expression: `bg="alpha(@accent, 0.4)"`).

In addition, styles **and layout nodes** can have the primitives from the section
[Beyond the flat rectangle](#beyond-the-flat-rectangle): gradient, pattern, grain, vignette, inner
shadow, per-side border.

## Layout

Containers: `row` (horizontal), `column` (vertical), `stack` (one on top of another).

| Property | Effect |
|---|---|
| `width=` / `height=` | fixed size along the parent's axis |
| `flex=` | weight in the leftover space (default 1) |
| `gap=` `padding=` `padding-x=` `padding-y=` | spacing (containers) |
| `inset-x=` `inset-y=` | inner margin of a component |
| `max-width=` | limits the width and centers |
| `hide-below=` | hides when the window is narrower than this |
| `hide-below-height=` | hides when the window is shorter than this |
| `only-below-height=` | shows only when the window is shorter than this (a compact version of a tall header) |
| `show=#false` | hides |
| `style=` / `bg=` `radius=` | the node's background |
| `font=mono` / `font=ui` / `font="Liberation Serif"` | the component's font: the mono one, the interface one or **any installed family** (on Windows, see [Fonts on Windows](#fonts-on-windows)) |
| `c-<token>=color` | overrides a color token **on this node and its children** (e.g. `c-text="#fff"` on a dark sidebar) |

The child of a `row` that has a fixed `width=` and holds `channel-list` or `member-list` is resizable: the app draws a drag handle on the side facing the row's `flex` sibling, and the width people choose is added to the one you set. Without a `flex` sibling there's no handle.

## Fonts on Windows

Windows has no fontconfig, so a family name works differently there. The app only looks in `C:\Windows\Fonts`:

1. First, a file named after the family in lowercase, with no spaces, ending in `.ttf`: `Segoe UI` → `segoeui.ttf`,
   `Georgia` → `georgia.ttf`, `Cascadia Code` → `cascadiacode.ttf` (Windows 11). That one file is used for every
   weight, so bold and italic look like the regular.
2. Otherwise, the system font of the same kind, with real bold and italic. Names with `mono`, `code`, `consol`,
   `courier` or `term` get Consolas (or Courier New). Names with `serif`, `georgia`, `times`, `garamond` or
   `playfair`, and no `sans`, get Georgia (or Times New Roman). `DejaVu Sans` and `DejaVu Sans Mono` get Segoe UI
   Symbol. Anything else gets Segoe UI (or Arial, then Tahoma). Emoji come from Segoe UI Emoji.

So the defaults, `Inter` and `JetBrains Mono`, show as Segoe UI and Consolas, and `font="Liberation Serif"` shows as
Georgia. Installing a font usually doesn't change this. Font files keep names like `JetBrainsMono-Regular.ttf`, and
fonts installed only for your user (the Windows default, in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft\Windows\Fonts`) aren't
searched. For a theme that looks right on both systems, use font names that say what they are (with `Mono` or
`Serif` in them), and check the theme with Segoe UI, Consolas and Georgia.

## Components

| Component | Properties |
|---|---|
| `guild-bar` | `variant=bar\|dock\|list` `icon-style=fill\|soft\|outline` `orientation=vertical\|horizontal` `shape=circle\|squircle\|square\|text` `size=48` `labels=#true` `home=#false` `indicators=#false` |
| `channel-list` | `variant=discord\|tree\|pills` `header=#false` |
| `user-panel` | `variant=discord\|tty` |
| `header` | `variant=discord\|minimal\|tty` `divider=#false` |
| `tabs` | `variant=pills\|underline\|tty` |
| `messages` | `variant=cozy\|irc\|bubbles` `avatar=circle\|squircle\|square\|none` `avatar-size=40` `spacing=16` `font-size=` `call-style=` `call-tint=0.22` ([call screen](#the-call-screen)) |
| `composer` | `variant=box\|pill\|prompt` `typing=#false` |
| `member-list` | `variant=discord\|tty` |
| `status-bar` | `variant=pills\|tty\|plain` `items="conn ping ram frame voice spacer theme keys clock"` (also `me mic deaf`: your status and the mute/deafen buttons with the device menu, for layouts without a `user-panel`) |
| `label` | `text=` `size=` `weight=regular\|medium\|semibold\|bold` `color=token` `align=left\|center\|right`, plus [display typography](#display-typography-in-label) |
| `shape` | circle, ring, arc, rounded rectangle, line ([details](#shape-and-rule)) |
| `rule` | plain, dashed, double, newspaper or ornamented rule ([details](#shape-and-rule)) |
| `starfield` `orbit` `aurora` `dunes` `topography` `radar` | [procedural backgrounds](#procedural-backgrounds) (first child of a `stack`) |
| `window-controls` | the three window buttons, which really work: close, minimize, maximize. `size=12` `gap=8` `color=` `color2=` `color3=` `align=` |
| `logo` | `variant=ascii\|wordmark` `size=` |
| `topbar` | top bar (tabs, search, help) |
| `crt` | `spacing=3` `strength=0.08` |
| `spacer` | empty space |

A name that doesn't exist shows up with a red border and the file line, to make it easy to spot.

### The call screen

Clicking a voice channel replaces the chat with a grid of one tile per person, drawn by the `messages` component, so it follows the theme:

| Property | Effect |
|---|---|
| `call-style="card"` | a named style for each tile: background, gradient, border, shadow, glow, sheen, grain. Without it, the tile uses `elevated` with a thin `border` |
| `call-tint=0.22` | how much of each person's photo color goes into the tile background, from `0` (only the theme) to `1` |
| `avatar=` | the shape of the photos in the tiles, the same as in the messages (`none` becomes a circle there) |

The name and activity use `text`, switching to white or near black when the photo color makes `text` hard to read. The speaking ring uses `online`, and the bar of call buttons uses `bg`, `elevated`, `border` and the theme's corners. With `variant=irc` the call is a text list. Example from `vidro.kdl`:

```kdl
messages flex=1 avatar=squircle call-style=card call-tint=0.16
```

## Beyond the flat rectangle

Everything here is optional, works in a `style "…"` or directly on a layout node, and the colors are expressions
(`"alpha(@accent, 0.4)"`, or just the token name). They are evaluated with the current tokens, so they
follow light/dark mode, the chosen accent color and the `c-…` of that part of the layout.

```kdl
styles {
    style "painel" radius=10 \
        gradient="alpha(@elevated, 0.9) alpha(@surface, 0.75)" gradient-angle=90 \
        pattern=dots pattern-color="alpha(@text, 0.05)" pattern-size=16 pattern-width=1 \
        grain="alpha(@text, 0.04)" vignette="alpha(black, 0.3)" vignette-size=0.55 \
        inner-shadow="alpha(black, 0.2)" inner-shadow-size=14 \
        border-gradient="@accent transparent @border" border-gradient-angle=70 border-width=1 \
        border-bottom="@border" border-bottom-width=2 \
        hover-bg="alpha(@accent, 0.05)"
}
layout { column gradient="@bg @rail" grain="alpha(@text, 0.05)" { … } }
```

| Property | What it does |
|---|---|
| `gradient="a b"` or `"a b c"` | gradient of 2 or 3 colors (separated by spaces) |
| `gradient-angle=90` | degrees: `0` from left to right, `90` from top to bottom (default) |
| `pattern=dots\|lines\|grid\|diagonal` | repeating pattern; requires `pattern-color` |
| `pattern-size=16` `pattern-width=1` | distance between repeats and stroke thickness (or dot radius) |
| `grain=color` | grain: fine noise, tinted by this color |
| `vignette=color` `vignette-size=0.55` | darkens (or tints) the edges; `size` is where it starts, from 0 (center) to 1 (corners) |
| `inner-shadow=color` `inner-shadow-size=14` | inward shadow |
| `border-gradient="a b c"` `border-gradient-angle=` `border-width=` | gradient border |
| `border-top=color` `border-right=` `border-bottom=` `border-left=` | border on that side only |
| `border-top-width=2` (same for the other sides) | thickness of that side (default: `border-width`, or 1) |
| `hover-bg=color` | background drawn on top when the mouse is over it, with a transition |
| `drop-shadow=color` `drop-shadow-size=32` `drop-shadow-y=10` | soft, **hollow** shadow: it doesn't darken what's under a translucent panel (the old `shadow=` does) |
| `corners=left\|right\|top\|bottom` | which corners the fill rounds: a window of two side-by-side panels |
| `border=color` | full border, to use directly on a node (in styles, it already exists) |

Cost: a 2-color gradient is just vertices. Grain, pattern, vignette and 3-color gradients are tiny textures
generated **once** and repeated: one quad per frame, no noise recalculated. A theme that doesn't
use any of this doesn't go through this code.

Very strong grain gets in the way more in dark mode than in light mode. When the value needs to change with the mode,
use separate styles: `styles mode=light { style "pagina" grain="alpha(@text, 0.07)" }` and
`styles mode=dark { style "pagina" grain="alpha(@text, 0.025)" }`. A node can also appear in only one
mode: `when=modo-claro`, `when=modo-escuro`.

## Display typography in `label`

```kdl
// Real tracking: no "O R B I T A L" with spaces.
label text="ORBITAL" tracking=8 size=15 weight=bold font=mono

// Runs: different color, weight, size and font on the same line, on the same baseline.
label height=38 size=9 color=muted font=mono span-gap=9 {
    span "01" size=18 color=accent
    span "CANAIS" en="CHANNELS" tracking=3
}

// Effects.
label text="larperCord" size=40 shadow="alpha(black, 0.5)" shadow-x=2 shadow-y=2
label text="larperCord" size=40 shadow="alpha(@accent, 0.4)" shadow-blur=3   // glow
label text="larperCord" size=40 color=bg outline=accent outline-width=2
label text="larperCord" size=40 text-gradient="@text @accent" text-gradient-angle=0
```

| Property | What it does |
|---|---|
| `tracking=` | extra space between letters, in pixels (can be negative) |
| `color=` | also accepts an expression: `color="alpha(@text, 0.7)"` |
| `text-en=` (`en=` on `span`) | English version of the text |
| `span "text"` | a piece of the line; `size` `weight` `color` `font` `tracking` inherit from `label` |
| `span-gap=` | space between spans |
| `shadow=color` `shadow-x=` `shadow-y=` `shadow-blur=` | shadow; with `blur` it becomes a soft halo |
| `outline=color` `outline-width=` | outline |
| `text-gradient="a b"` `text-gradient-angle=` | gradient on the text (default: horizontal) |

A `label` with none of this stays the same, on the same path as always. Effects draw the text more
times: save them for titles and wordmarks.

## `shape` and `rule`

Shapes and rules that are actually drawn, instead of Unicode characters. Pile them up in a `stack` to compose.

```kdl
stack width=28 {
    shape kind=ring size=22 thickness=1 color="alpha(@accent, 0.35)"
    shape kind=arc size=22 thickness=1.6 start=-150 sweep=250 color=accent dot="@text" dot-size=2.4
    shape kind=circle size=6 color=accent
}
shape kind=rounded radius=6 color=accent fill="alpha(@accent, 0.1)" thickness=1
shape kind=line angle=30 thickness=2 color=border

rule height=1 color=border
rule height=1 kind=dashed dash=3 gap=3 color="alpha(@accent, 0.45)"
rule height=7 kind=oxford color=text                                 // thick line over thin line
rule height=11 kind=double color=text ornament=star ornament-color=accent ornament-size=11
rule height=20 ornament-text="§" ornament-size=16 font="Liberation Serif"
rule width=1 vertical=#true color=border
rule height=1 fade=#true color=accent                                // fades out at the ends
```

| `shape` | |
|---|---|
| `kind=` | `circle` `ring` `arc` `rounded` `line` |
| `color=` `thickness=` | stroke color and thickness |
| `size=` | diameter (default: the node's shorter side); on `line`, the length |
| `fill=` | fill of `ring` and `rounded` |
| `start=` `sweep=` | start and opening of the `arc`, in degrees |
| `dot=color` `dot-size=` | a dot at the tip of the `arc` |
| `radius=` | corners of `rounded` |
| `angle=` | tilt of the `line`, in degrees |
| `align=left\|center\|right` `offset-x=` `offset-y=` | position inside the node |

| `rule` | |
|---|---|
| `kind=` | `solid` `dashed` `dotted` `double` `oxford` |
| `color=` `thickness=` | color and thickness |
| `dash=` `gap=` | size of the dash and of the gap on `dashed` |
| `vertical=#true` | from top to bottom (give the node a `width=`) |
| `fade=#true` | fades out at both ends |
| `ornament=` | `diamond` `dot` `ring` `star`, in the middle of the rule |
| `ornament-text=` | a character in the middle, instead of the shape (uses the node's `font=`) |
| `ornament-color=` `ornament-size=` `ornament-gap=` | color, size and the gap in the rule around it |

## Procedural backgrounds

They go as the first child of a `stack`, behind everything else. They are **static by default**: generated
once, they stay in a texture, and a static theme doesn't wake the app.

```kdl
layout {
    stack {
        starfield color="alpha(@muted, 0.75)" color2="alpha(@accent, 0.8)" density=1.1
        orbit center-x=0.73 center-y=0.4 rings=7 color="alpha(@accent, 0.4)" color2=accent
        column { … panels … }
    }
}
```

| Component | Colors | Properties |
|---|---|---|
| `starfield` | `color` distant stars, `color2` the near ones | `density=1` |
| `orbit` | `color` the orbits, `color2` the moons | `center-x=0.7` `center-y=0.35` `rings=6` |
| `aurora` | `color` and `color2`, one for each curtain | |
| `dunes` | `color`, `color2`, `color3`: hills from back to front (the sky is the `gradient` of the surrounding node) | |
| `topography` | `color` | `levels=14` (how many contour lines) |
| `radar` | `color` rings, `color2` the sweep | `center-x=0.5` `center-y=0.5` `rings=5` |

All of them accept `seed=` (a different drawing), and all except `topography` accept motion:
`motion=#true`, or better `motion="$opcao"`, so the user can choose, and `motion-fps=10` (15 at most).
Motion only shifts the texture or redraws a small piece, and it stops on its own with "Reduce motion" and
with the window minimized or out of focus.

The mask is only shape: the color comes at draw time. Switching mode or accent color generates nothing
new. Only `orbit` and `radar` depend on size, and they are rebuilt once when the window stops changing.

**Contrast first.** Text never sits directly on a strong background: put a translucent panel in
between (`gradient="alpha(@surface, 0.9) alpha(@surface, 0.76)"`) and check both modes. Use colors
derived from tokens: `@muted` in dark mode is light stars, and in light mode it becomes ink on paper.

## Light and dark

Every theme has both versions. Blocks with `mode=` only apply in one of the modes:

```kdl
colors mode=dark  { bg "#0b0906"; text "#ffcf73" }
colors mode=light { bg "#f4efe2"; text "#2e2412" }
roles mode=light "#7a4a00" "#9c3f10"
```

Without `mode=`, the block applies in both. If the theme doesn't define the light one, it's derived
from the palette (near-white paper, dark ink and a darkened accent). In the layout, `cl-<token>` and `cd-<token>`
override a color in light only or in dark only. The user chooses in Settings → Appearance
(Dark / Light / Follow system), or on the command line: `--mode claro`.

## Theme options

A theme can offer on/off switches, which show up in Settings → Appearance:

```kdl
options {
    option "crt" label="Efeito CRT" description="Linhas de varredura…" default=#true
    option "verde" label="Fósforo verde" default=#false
}
```

Ways to use the options:

| Where | How |
|---|---|
| hide/show a node | `crt when=crt`, `tabs unless=compacto` |
| boolean property | `banner="$banner"`, `typing="$!digitando"` (the `!` inverts) |
| block of colors, roles, styles | `colors mode=dark when=verde { … }` |
| style | `style "card" sheen="$brilho"` |

The choices are saved per theme in `settings.kdl`: `~/.config/larpercord/settings.kdl` on Linux,
`%APPDATA%\larpercord\settings.kdl` on Windows.

## Custom colors (without editing the `.kdl`)

In **Settings → Appearance → Theme colors** you can replace any color token
(`bg`, `sidebar`, `text`, `accent`, `link`, `bubble-self`…) and the eight role colors with a
free-form hex. It applies only to the **current theme and the current mode** (dark or light), and it takes priority
over the global “Accent color”.

- `#RRGGBB` for an opaque color; `#RRGGBBAA` for a color with transparency.
- Click an item in the grid, paste the hex and press Enter.
- “Clear this color” returns that item to the theme; “Reset theme” erases the theme's choices.
- The choices are kept in `settings.kdl` as `theme-colors "name" mode=dark accent="#…"`,
  so they don't change the theme file.
- Parts that use a fixed `c-…` in the layout (some themes do this to keep contrast) keep
  the file's color; to change those, edit the `.kdl`.

### In English

The interface comes in Portuguese and English. For your theme to look right in both, put the English
version alongside: `label-en=` and `description-en=` on options, and `description-en=` on the `theme` node.
Without them, the Portuguese text shows up.

```kdl
theme "meu-tema" description="Servidores embaixo." description-en="Servers at the bottom."
options {
    option "crt" label="Efeito CRT" label-en="CRT effect" description="Linhas de varredura" description-en="Scanlines"
}
```

The tests (`zig build test`) load every built-in theme and build the layout of each one.
To share a theme of your own, send it to the community gallery (next section).

## Sharing your theme

Finished themes can go in the [community gallery](https://rshacudevidro.github.io/larperCord/community-themes.html),
where anyone can see a live preview, open them in the theme builder or download the `.kdl`. The gallery is built from
`themes/community/` in this repository.

1. Make the theme in the [theme builder](https://rshacudevidro.github.io/larperCord/theme-builder.html), or by hand. In the
   builder's **File** tab (or click the file name at the top), fill in the name, the author, a description and the
   license. "Ready for the community gallery?", at the end of that tab, lists anything still missing.
2. Download the `.kdl` with **Export** → **Download .kdl**. The file is named after the theme: "Neon Dusk" becomes
   `neon-dusk.kdl`.
3. Fork the repository, add the file to `themes/community/` and open a pull request. One theme per pull request.

The `theme` node carries the metadata:

```kdl
theme "Neon Dusk" author="your name" description-en="Purple dusk over a dark city." description="Crepúsculo roxo sobre uma cidade escura." license="CC0-1.0" preview=classic
```

| Field | Rule |
|---|---|
| name (the first argument) | up to 48 characters. The file name is the name in lowercase with hyphens (`neon-dusk.kdl`) |
| `author=` | your name or handle, up to 80 characters |
| `description-en=` / `description=` | at least one (English or Portuguese), up to 240 characters each. Both is best |
| `license=` | an open license from the list below, written as its [SPDX identifier](https://spdx.org/licenses/). The app ignores it |
| `preview=` | optional, one of the thumbnails listed in [Top-level nodes](#top-level-nodes) |

The licenses the gallery takes, alone or joined with `AND` / `OR` (`GPL-3.0-or-later OR MIT`): `CC0-1.0`,
`CC-BY-4.0`, `CC-BY-SA-4.0`, `CC-BY-3.0`, `CC-BY-SA-3.0`, `MIT`, `MIT-0`, `ISC`, `0BSD`, `BSD-2-Clause`,
`BSD-3-Clause`, `Apache-2.0`, `MPL-2.0`, `Zlib`, `Unlicense`, `WTFPL`, `EUPL-1.2`, `GPL-2.0-only`, `GPL-2.0-or-later`,
`GPL-3.0-only`, `GPL-3.0-or-later`, `LGPL-2.1-only`, `LGPL-2.1-or-later`, `LGPL-3.0-only`, `LGPL-3.0-or-later`,
`AGPL-3.0-only` and `AGPL-3.0-or-later`. All of them let people use and change the theme.

What is checked:

- **It has to load in the app.** `python3 tools/gen_site.py` reads every file in `themes/community/` with the app's rules
  (syntax, color tokens, color expressions, component names, the metadata above) and stops with `file:line:column` at
  the first problem, so a broken file fails the site build. `node tools/theme_builder_test.js` then loads each theme
  with the site's copy of the app's theme loader (`docs/assets/site/theme-builder-core.js`), in both modes and with
  every option. CI runs both on every pull request. You can run the same check before sending:
  `python3 tools/gen_site.py --check-community` (on Windows, `py tools/gen_site.py --check-community`). To see it
  in the app, put the file in your themes folder (the table at the top of this page), quit larperCord if it's
  running, and start it with `--theme neon-dusk`.
- **A name of its own.** Not the name of a built-in theme (a file called `orbital.kdl` would take its place in the app)
  and not one already in the gallery. A built-in theme with only the name changed is turned away: change its colors or
  its layout.
- **No copyrighted logos or fonts.** Only `.kdl` files go in the folder, so no images or font files. Don't redraw
  someone else's logo or wordmark with `label`, `shape` or ASCII art, and only name fonts people can get freely.
  Fonts are looked up on the user's system and never ship with the theme. On Linux that goes by family, through
  fontconfig. On Windows it goes by a file in `C:\Windows\Fonts` named after the family, or else Segoe UI, Consolas
  or Georgia ([Fonts on Windows](#fonts-on-windows)), so check that your theme still looks right with those.
- **An open license** from the list above. It tells people they may use and change the theme. If the colors came from
  someone else's theme (the builder's **Open** → "Colors from a Discord theme", for example), that theme's license has to allow
  it, and the description should credit its author.

## Design tips

What separates a good-looking theme from a strange one is almost never the accent color. It's usually:

- **A single concept.** "Notebook", "terminal", "1989 laptop"… and everything follows it: colors,
  font, corners and borders.
- **Surfaces that separate.** Background, panels and elevated elements need clear steps of
  lightness. Purple on purple on purple turns into one blob.
- **Few bright colors.** One accent and, at most, one secondary. Use `roles` with colors from the
  same family so the names don't become a rainbow.
- **One text font**, and at most one for headings (`header … font="Liberation Serif"`).
- **Enough contrast** for `text`, `muted` and `faint` against each panel's background. Use `c-…`
  when part of the layout has a very different background (a dark sidebar in a light theme).
