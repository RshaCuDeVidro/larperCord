# larperCord

**A native Discord client for Linux and Windows, at about 130 MB of RAM, whose entire interface is a theme file.**

Zig · SDL3 · Dear ImGui · FreeType · zero Electron

**English** · [Português](README.pt-BR.md)

![larperCord themes](docs/themes.png)

*The same binary and the same data, only the `.kdl` file changes. There are 11 themes, each in light and dark. The last tile is `cupertino` in light.*

> [!WARNING]
> **Third-party clients break Discord's Terms of Service**, and your account can be banned.
> Use it at your own risk, ideally with a secondary account. This project has no affiliation
> with Discord Inc. With no token configured, the app runs in a **demo mode** with fake data.

### If Discord locks your account

Discord disables accounts or forces a password reset when it thinks an account is a spam bot or was compromised. It can happen on any client, but third-party clients tend to trigger it more often. It already happened to this project's developer, after a day of testing. **Use a secondary account.**

These are the usual triggers people report, so do them in the official client:

- joining or leaving servers, the most common one
- disconnecting and reconnecting often, which includes restarting the app over and over
- opening DMs with new people
- changing your friends list
- editing your profile while connected here

If it happens, reset your password from discord.com. If the account stays locked, [appeal here](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360000029731). Discord doesn't publish these rules, so this list comes from the experience of people who make third-party clients.

### If your antivirus complains

The Windows build isn't signed, so SmartScreen warns about it. A scanner may also call it a Discord token stealer, likely because a Discord client is full of the same words a stealer has, such as "token" and "Authorization". One sandbox scored version 0.5.0 that way from a pattern rule, while its behavior report showed no credential access and, in demo mode, no network at all.

The token only goes to Discord, and it stays in the system keyring (Credential Manager on Windows) or, without one, in a private file. The code is public, so you can read it or build it yourself. Only download larperCord from this repository.

## Why

The official client is a whole browser dressed up as an app. On the same PC:

| | RAM (PSS) | Idle CPU | Binary |
|---|---|---|---|
| Vesktop (Electron) | **1279 MB** | 12–47%¹ | 287 MB |
| Discord Phoenix (Rust) | ~290 MB² | 0.1%² | not released |
| **larperCord**, real account | **~130 MB**³ | **0–0.4%**⁴ | **~14 MB** |

<sub>¹ Average since launch, measured with `ps`. Arch Linux, Hyprland, GTX 1050 Ti, 1280×800 window, `ReleaseFast` build.
² Not measured by us and not a side-by-side test: an early Windows 11 build, from a Task Manager screenshot [posted by Discord's CTO](https://x.com/svishnevskiy/status/2118081920194203799). The app isn't out yet.
³ 125–140 MB in one account's normal use on the same PC, about 70 MB right after opening. Yours depends on your servers, members and images; Settings → Performance shows where it goes. About 35 MB of the total is the NVIDIA driver, libraries and fonts. The published Linux file carries SDL3, libcurl and OpenSSL inside: side by side in demo, it used about 2 MB more than a build using the system's copies.
⁴ Measured with `tools/membench.sh`, with demo data, a real window and GIF autoplay off. An animated GIF on screen costs about 2.5% CPU.</sub>

## What's in it

- **Themes that rearrange everything.** A layout tree (`row`/`column`/`flex`/`gap`), 11 components
  with variants, colors overridden per layout piece (`c-text="#fff"`), styles, and color tokens with expressions (`mix(wal:0, black, 0.4)`).
  [Theme guide →](themes/README.md)
- **Reloads on save.** Edit the `.kdl` and the window changes right away (inotify on Linux, folder
  change notifications on Windows; no polling). Errors show up as `file:line:column`.
- **Follows your wallpaper.** On Linux, themes with `palette "wal"` use pywal's colors and follow the change.
  On Windows the colors are only read when the `HOME` variable is set, and they don't follow the change live
  ([details](themes/README.md#top-level-nodes)); otherwise these themes use the default palette.
- **Real blur on Linux.** The `vidro` theme has a transparent background and your compositor (Hyprland, KDE…)
  applies the blur, at no cost to the app. Windows has no blur: there, turn on the theme's "Opaque background"
  option for solid cards.
- **Connects to the real Discord**: WebSocket gateway with heartbeat, **session RESUME**,
  **zlib-stream** and reconnects; IDENTIFY and headers in the web client's format (the same
  approach as the web client). REST for history, sending, editing, deleting, reactions and "typing",
  one request at a time and respecting the rate limit.
- **Real voice calls**: voice gateway v8, UDP/RTP, Opus at 48 kHz stereo, **DAVE (E2EE)** through
  libdave/MLS, mic and output through SDL3, mute/deafen, a "speaking" ring and a **mixer with a
  volume per person**. The voice thread only starts when you join a call.
- **Calls in DMs and groups**: the phone button in the header calls; an incoming call shows a card with
  Accept and Decline, a ringtone (silent in Do Not Disturb or a muted conversation), a system notification
  and a taskbar flash, even from the tray. Right-click the mic or headphone button to switch devices
  mid-call; `Ctrl+Shift+M` mutes and `Ctrl+Shift+D` deafens.
- **Discord interactions**: right-click menus on messages, users, channels and servers;
  a hover action bar; **replies** (with the little curve and a click that jumps to the
  original); **edit** (`↑` in the empty box edits your last one); **delete**; **reactions**;
  mouse **text selection** across several messages + `Ctrl+C`; a **profile card** with
  "Message @someone"; **direct messages**; mentions highlighted by Discord's rule (you, your roles,
  @everyone and @here, as the server allows).
- **Sending options**: choose whether a reply pings its author, send silently (`@silent`), without link
  previews or without pinging anyone, and mark each file as a spoiler or give it alt text. Vote in
  polls and see who voted, see who reacted, and page through more than 50 pins.
- **Channel tabs**, a command palette with fuzzy search (`Ctrl+K` / `Ctrl+Shift+P`: channels, DMs,
  servers, themes, status, mark as read and the toggles), keyboard shortcuts and optional
  vim-style navigation (`j`/`k`, `gg`/`G`, `J`/`K` switches channel, `/` searches).
- **Panels your size**: drag the edge of the channel list, the member list or the panes of a split view; a double-click goes back to the theme's width. Your choice is saved and follows you between themes, and the conversation always keeps enough room.
- **Lua plugins**: `.lua` files in your plugins folder (`~/.config/larpercord/plugins/` on Linux,
  `%APPDATA%\larpercord\plugins\` on Windows) that add panels, right-click
  entries, notes under messages, commands and reminders, on a thread of their own with an instruction
  and a memory limit, so they can't hold up the interface. Scam guard, CVE radar, GitHub cards, what did I miss, translate,
  reminders, highlights, clean links, and links and files come with the app. [Guide and API →](docs/plugins.md)
- **Voice settings.** In Settings → Voice you pick the microphone and output (remembered by name, back to the default if they disappear, switchable mid-call), adjust volumes, see the mic level live and use "Test microphone" to hear yourself. Voice activity has an adjustable threshold on the meter or an automatic mode that learns your background noise. "Push to talk" takes a key or mouse button and works while the window is focused (SDL has no portable global shortcut). There's a high-pass against rumble, a noise gate and a sound for each call event (joining, leaving, someone else joining or leaving, mute, deafen, the ringtone), built-in or your own WAV or Ogg Opus file, each of which can be turned off. The voice panel shows ping, quality by color and when you're transmitting, and warns you if the mic doesn't open or if the server muted or deafened you. Other people's mute and deafen show in the call list.
- **Runs on Linux and Windows.** Linux prefers native Wayland in a Wayland session, with X11 fallback. Windows 10/11 builds come from the same code; tokens stay in Credential Manager.
- **Stays in the tray.** The icon sits in the system tray from launch until you quit, with Open and Quit in its menu even while the window is open, and closing keeps the app connected there. A left click on the icon shows or hides the window. "Close to tray" in Settings → Advanced turns it all off: no icon, and closing quits. Without a tray, closing quits. Opening it a second time brings up the running window. On Linux the tray needs a StatusNotifier panel.
- **Updates itself.** Checks when opening or from Settings → Updates. One button downloads, installs and restarts. Updates are signed, and a version without the right signature isn't installed. There's a restart button and a What's new page with the changes in each version.
- **Video volume.** The in-app player has a volume slider, remembered between runs.
- **Microphone noise suppression.** Settings → Voice → Noise suppression (Off / RNNoise), on by default and switchable mid-call. It uses [RNNoise](https://github.com/xiph/rnnoise) 0.2 (BSD), built into the executable and running on your computer, with no internet. It reduces steady noise such as fans, hiss and air conditioning; typing and bangs may get through, other voices stay and yours may get a bit muffled. It delays your mic by 20 ms and costs about 2% to 3.5% of a core on a 2011 Core i5 while the mic is open, and less on newer processors; off, muted or with the push-to-talk key released, it costs nothing.
- **Bots and apps.** Bots and webhooks carry a BOT tag (with a check mark when verified). Discord's newer component messages (Components V2) show text, thumbnails, separators, galleries, files and link buttons. Buttons, select menus and bot forms (modals) work, and `/` lists the slash commands of the server's bots and of your apps, with a panel for their options and files. Forwarded messages appear as cards.
- **Discord markdown.** Headings, `-#` small text, quotes, lists and `[text](url)` links, which show the real address on hover. Code blocks have line numbers, and text in embeds can be selected and copied.
- **Manage what's yours.** Edit a server (name, description, icon, banner) or a group DM (name, icon, members), and edit or delete threads when you have permission. Server banners appear at the top of the channel list and on invite cards; click one to see it in full.
- **Moderation.** Kick, ban, time out and server mute or deafen from a person's menu, only when your role allows it, with a reason for the audit log; a Bans list in the server menu. The message box shows slowmode and says why you can't send (permission, a locked thread, a timeout, an AutoMod quarantine). Joining from an invite warns first, and servers with rules or onboarding open them in the app.
- **Your account, synced.** Block, ignore, friend requests (also by username), mute and notification levels, your status with a duration, a custom status and your profile's display name, pronouns and About me are saved to your Discord account, like the official app. Message requests and spam stay apart from your DMs. Rich Presence shows the game you're playing, off by default.
- **Text in any language.** Arabic letters are joined and right-to-left text comes in the right order ([GNU FriBidi](https://github.com/fribidi/fribidi)). A letter the theme's font lacks, in any script, comes from a system font that has it, looked up only when such text appears.
- **Code diagnostics (optional).** See errors while typing a code block, from a language server you choose. Off by default, nothing bundled or downloaded. [Guide →](docs/lsp.md)
- **Threads and forums.** Active threads nested under the parent channel (collapsible, with unreads), opening as a normal conversation, with tabs, split view, drafts, cache and search; a card with the message count and last activity on the message that started it; create, join, leave, rename, tag, archive and lock threads from the menu, and see archived ones, private ones included. Forums and media channels show the list of posts instead of a conversation, with local search, sorting by activity, pages on demand and "New Post" with title, tags and text. Permissions come from the parent channel, and the member list shows who's in the thread.
- **Emoji and autocomplete.** Custom emoji show as images (animated too), large when the message is only emoji, and in reactions. PNG, APNG and GIF stickers show as images, and the Stickers tab in the GIF picker sends them. The picker has the full Unicode list, search in Portuguese and English, recents and your servers' emoji, and warns when an emoji needs Nitro. In the text box, `@`, `#`, `:ab` and `/` (slash commands) open a list (arrows, Tab/Enter, Esc or click); names with spaces become real mentions when sent. In data saver mode, custom emoji become `:name:`, with nothing downloaded. To regenerate the table: `tools/gen_emoji.py`.
- **Read state synced with Discord**: unreads and mentions correct on open, `MESSAGE_ACK` from another device clears them here, confirmations like the official client's (at most one per channel every 3 s; none on its own with the window unfocused), "mark as read" per channel and per server, "mark as unread" from a message.
- **NEW MESSAGES line** with a button that jumps to the first one and "mark as read"; the channel opens at the first unread (you can turn it off in Settings → Chat).
- **Pinned messages**: a pin in the header, pin and unpin from the menu; jumping to any old message loads around it, with "Jump to present".
- **Discord links open in the app** (`ptb.` and `canary.` too); invites become a card with the server and its members, a Join button (Go to server when you're already in it) and Open in browser.
- Clicking `@someone` opens the profile, `#channel` opens the channel; the timestamp shows the full date on hover.
- **Inbox** (`Ctrl+I`): unread DMs and mentions from every server, by channel, with
  previews, jump to the message and "mark all as read"; a tab with Discord's recent mentions.
- **Saved messages with notes** (`Ctrl+Shift+S`, right-click → Save message): only on your
  computer, in `~/.config/larpercord/saved-<account>.json` (`%APPDATA%\larpercord\saved-<account>.json`
  on Windows); nothing goes to Discord.
- **Local cache and offline search.** The last 200 messages seen in each channel stay in
  `~/.cache/larpercord/messages` (`%LOCALAPPDATA%\larpercord\messages` on Windows; 50 MB cap, and on
  Linux folders 700 and files 600): the conversation appears
  right away on open and the real history arrives on top, without jumping the scroll. `Ctrl+F` searches
  memory and the cache on every keystroke, without internet, with `from:name`, `in:channel`, `has:link`,
  `has:image` and `has:file`; clicking a result jumps to the message. You can turn it off and
  erase it in Settings → Privacy.
- **Multiple accounts.** Your own name's menu lists the saved accounts (name and picture) and switches
  right away; "Add account" goes back to sign-in without forgetting the others. The sign-in screen
  lists them too, and a token Discord refuses is forgotten instead of being tried again.
- **Discord-style settings** (`Ctrl+,`): 18 pages, theme switching with thumbnails,
  accent color and corners, **custom colors per theme and mode in hex**, font scale,
  compact mode, reduced motion, 12/24 h clock, spoilers…, saved in
  `~/.config/larpercord/settings.kdl` (`%APPDATA%\larpercord\settings.kdl` on Windows). If
  `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` or `XDG_CACHE_HOME` is set, the app uses it instead, on both systems.
- **Discord markdown**: **bold**, *italic*, ~~strikethrough~~, `code`, ||spoiler||, `<@id>`/`<#id>`
  mentions, links and color emoji; code blocks highlighted by their label (zig, c/cpp,
  js/ts, py, rust, go, sh, json, lua…) with a "Copy" button; a preview above the box while you type.
- **Videos playing in the conversation** (attachments and direct .mp4/.webm links) with **FFmpeg 7, 8
  or 9, if present** (loaded only on the first play, no build dependency): play/pause,
  progress bar, sound; up to 480p and about 30 fps. Without FFmpeg, the video opens in the browser. On
  Linux it's your distro's `ffmpeg` package. Windows has none, so Settings → Chat → Videos gets it once
  (Check for FFmpeg, then Download FFmpeg): about 80 MB from github.com/BtbN/FFmpeg-Builds, checked
  against a fixed SHA-256, about 128 MB on disk in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\larpercord\ffmpeg`. "Choose FFmpeg
  folder…" there takes a "shared" FFmpeg build you already have, and when FFmpeg isn't found the page
  says why (a static `ffmpeg` on PATH without the libraries, a version the app doesn't use, a library
  that didn't load). It also animates old Tenor GIFs that only exist as MP4.
- **Media**: spoilers and sensitive media stay covered until you click, with nothing downloaded before;
  expired Discord image links are refreshed on their own; voice messages have a player with a waveform;
  long GIFs play every frame, and a star on any GIF adds it to your favorites.
- **Proxy** (HTTP, HTTPS, SOCKS5, SOCKS5h; Tor at `socks5h://127.0.0.1:9050`), with separate fields for
  the address, port, login and password, for media from outside Discord or for everything except voice
  calls, which always connect directly (Settings → Network). The sign-in screen has it too ("Connect
  through a proxy") and offers it when it can't reach Discord.
- Grouped messages, day separators, "pending" sends confirmed by the server,
  a typing indicator, smooth scrolling with a virtualized list.

## Built-in themes

All of them have **light and dark modes** and **their own options** in Settings → Appearance.

| Theme | Idea | Exclusive |
|---|---|---|
| `classico` | the layout everyone knows, in pywal's colors (or the default palette) | server banner |
| `vidro` | translucent cards with the compositor's blur (Linux) | light reflection on the cards |
| `terminal` | tmux + IRC; in light, dot-matrix printer paper | CRT effect, ASCII logo, green phosphor |
| `subsolo` | underground hacking terminal, acid green and scanlines | horizontal rack, ultraviolet, ASCII logo |
| `orbital` | a flight console among the stars, with numbered systems | star field and orbits in the background, command composer, server strip in the footer |
| `editorial` | a printed magazine on grainy paper, masthead between rules and an index on the right | inverted layout, serif conversation, colophon |
| `bolhas` | a messenger with chat bubbles | "Delivered ✓✓" and a typing bubble |
| `zen` | one central column, larger letters | navigation hides itself |
| `papel` | a notebook with an index in the margin and serif titles | ruled sheet with a red margin |
| `escritorio` | a work tool, dark sidebar | top bar with search and help |
| `cupertino` | a Mac-style desktop: wallpaper and a floating window | working traffic lights, translucent sidebar, Dock with magnifier, bubbles |

## Install

**Download:** [Linux](https://github.com/RshaCuDeVidro/larperCord/releases/latest/download/larpercord-linux-x86_64) · [Windows](https://github.com/RshaCuDeVidro/larperCord/releases/latest/download/larpercord-windows-x86_64.zip) · [all versions](https://github.com/RshaCuDeVidro/larperCord/releases).

On Linux, make the file executable and run it: `chmod +x larpercord-linux-x86_64 && ./larpercord-linux-x86_64`. It can keep that name: an update replaces that same file. Keep it in a folder you own, like `~/.local/bin`, so it can update itself.

On Windows, unzip it and open `larpercord.exe` in the `larperCord` folder. Keep the three DLLs next to it (`SDL3.dll`, `libcurl-x64.dll`, `libcrypto-3-x64.dll`) and unzip it somewhere you can write to, not `C:\Program Files`, so it can update itself. It isn't code-signed yet: if SmartScreen says "Windows protected your PC", click **More info**, then **Run anyway**. On the releases page, take the zip: the loose `.exe` and DLLs there are for the updater and the install script.

The Linux build runs on distros from about 2022 onward (glibc 2.34 or newer). SDL3, libcurl and OpenSSL come inside it. FreeType, fontconfig, libwebp, Opus and zlib come from the system, and a desktop distro usually has them already. Before each release it's opened in Ubuntu 22.04 and 24.04, Debian 12 and 13, Fedora, openSUSE and Arch containers, in demo mode with no GPU.

On a Wayland desktop, the app connects natively through SDL3; XWayland is not required. For window decorations on GNOME, install your distro's `libdecor` package and its decoration plugin. To force a backend, run `SDL_VIDEO_DRIVER=wayland larpercord` or `SDL_VIDEO_DRIVER=x11 larpercord`. Add `--stats` to see the selected video driver and renderer. The installer provides `dev.larpercord.desktop` for the launcher icon.

Developers can check native Wayland at 1× and 2× scale, backend overrides and X11 fallback with `python3 tools/qa_wayland.py zig-out/bin/larpercord` after building (requires Weston, Xvfb and Python 3). This runs a separate headless compositor with demo data and no GPU or Discord account.

GitHub Actions builds the Linux file from this repository's code. With the GitHub CLI you can check it: `gh attestation verify larpercord-linux-x86_64 --repo RshaCuDeVidro/larperCord`. The Windows files have no attestation yet, so compare them with `SHA256SUMS` from the same release. In PowerShell, in the folder with both files (`True` means it matches):

```powershell
(Get-FileHash .\larpercord-windows-x86_64.zip).Hash -eq ((Select-String 'larpercord-windows-x86_64.zip' .\SHA256SUMS).Line -split '\s+')[0]
```

On Linux, `sha256sum -c --ignore-missing SHA256SUMS` does the same.

Or use a script:

**Linux** (x86_64, no sudo: the program in `~/.local/bin`, plus a menu entry and an icon):

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RshaCuDeVidro/larperCord/main/install.sh | sh
```

**Windows 10/11** (for your user, no administrator: the program in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\larperCord`, plus a Start menu entry), in PowerShell. It closes larperCord first if it's open:

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RshaCuDeVidro/larperCord/main/install.ps1 | iex
```

Both download the latest [release](https://github.com/RshaCuDeVidro/larperCord/releases) and check it against `SHA256SUMS`. On Linux the script lists any system library that's missing. On a distro older than 2022, [build from source](#building). After that, the app updates itself: Settings → Updates. Running a script again also installs the newest version.

## Connecting your account

The token is **never** in the code, in a log or in an error message, and it's wiped from memory on
exit. On Linux and Windows, the simplest way is the sign-in screen: paste the token and keep "Remember"
on. The app looks in this order:

1. The `LARPER_TOKEN` variable, which is never saved.
2. The accounts saved with "Remember", starting with the last one used. Each has its own entry in the
   system's safe storage: the keyring on Linux (`service larpercord-account account <ID>`), Credential
   Manager on Windows (`larperCord/account/<ID>`). Without it, the token goes in
   `~/.config/larpercord/tokens/<ID>` with `chmod 600` on Linux, or `%APPDATA%\larpercord\tokens\<ID>`
   on Windows.
3. On Linux only, the older single entry, which you can still create by hand:
   ```bash
   secret-tool store --label='larperCord' service larpercord   # paste the token when asked
   ```
   or the file `~/.config/larpercord/token`, which must be `chmod 600`.

The list of saved accounts (only ID, name and avatar) is in `~/.config/larpercord/accounts` on Linux
and `%APPDATA%\larpercord\accounts` on Windows, and they appear in the user menu for switching.

To use `LARPER_TOKEN` for one run without saving it anywhere, in bash or zsh:

```bash
read -rs LARPER_TOKEN && LARPER_TOKEN="$LARPER_TOKEN" larpercord
```

In PowerShell (use the folder where you unzipped it if you didn't use the install script). The last
line clears the variable from the window; the app already has its own copy:

```powershell
$env:LARPER_TOKEN = [Net.NetworkCredential]::new('', (Read-Host 'Token' -AsSecureString)).Password
& "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\Programs\larperCord\larpercord.exe"
Remove-Item Env:LARPER_TOKEN
```

The variable only counts when the app starts: if larperCord is already open, even only in the tray,
quit it first (**Quit** in the tray icon's menu).

`--demo` forces demo mode even with a token. Still missing: screen sharing and camera. Channels
without access only show a notice. Notifications go through `notify-send` on Linux (from libnotify)
and through the tray on Windows, and clicking one doesn't open the channel yet. Voice uses the
system's audio backend through SDL3 and only starts its thread when you join a call.

## How it stays light

No magic, just many small decisions:

1. **It sleeps when nothing happens.** The loop waits in `SDL_WaitEvent`. Network, file changes (inotify
   on Linux, folder notifications on Windows) and the clock wake the app with events. No animation, no redraw. A frame that comes out the same as the last one
   never reaches the GPU, and a mouse just moving asks for fewer frames.
2. **No browser.** Everything is drawn with Dear ImGui's `ImDrawList` on top of SDL_Renderer.
3. **Fonts are mapped, not copied.** Each font file is one memory map (`mmap` on Linux, `MapViewOfFile`
   on Windows) shared by every weight and family. Only the pages read stay in RAM. (Loading 4 weights of
   Inter + emoji the naive way cost about 90 MB.)
4. **Only the video driver it needs.** On Linux machines with only an NVIDIA GPU, glvnd also loaded
   Mesa + LLVM (about 23 MB) for nothing. The app detects that and avoids it.
5. **Markdown is parsed once**, when the message arrives. The UI only lays out the
   spans, with a **height cache per width**.
6. **A virtualized list**: binary search for the first visible item, then draw only the screen.
7. **Memory has ceilings**: 1,500 messages per channel and 3,000 in total, with old ones freed. After a
   minute in the tray or minimized, images leave memory too, except small ones that were on screen.
8. **On Linux, fontconfig gets freed** after fonts are resolved (`FcFini` + `malloc_trim`). Windows has
   no fontconfig: fonts are opened straight from `C:\Windows\Fonts`.
9. **No blinking cursor**: a cursor blinking on its own would keep the CPU awake.
10. **A lean binary**: a release build without debug symbols. The Linux file is about 14 MB with SDL3, libcurl and OpenSSL inside, built with only the parts the app uses and no exported symbols, and about 8 MB built against the system's copies. On Windows those three come as DLLs next to the `.exe`.

## Building

For the experimental native **macOS / Apple Silicon** build and `.app` packaging,
see [the macOS guide](docs/macos.md).

On Linux you need **Zig 0.17**, **SDL3**, **FreeType**, **fontconfig** and **libcurl** (with WebSocket, 7.86+).
Recommended fonts on Linux: Inter, JetBrains Mono and Noto Color Emoji (fontconfig picks substitutes if one is
missing). On Windows the app uses Segoe UI, Consolas and Segoe UI Emoji.
Optional: **FFmpeg 7, 8 or 9** (libavformat 61–63) to play video inside the app; any other version
is ignored and the video opens in the browser.

```bash
# Arch
sudo pacman -S zig sdl3 freetype2 fontconfig curl inter-font ttf-jetbrains-mono noto-fonts-emoji

zig build -Doptimize=ReleaseFast
./zig-out/bin/larpercord --theme vidro
```

The Windows build is made from Linux. `tools/windows_deps.sh` downloads SDL3, curl, OpenSSL, FreeType, Opus,
zlib and libwebp for Windows, at fixed versions with checked hashes:

```bash
tools/windows_deps.sh && zig build -Dtarget=x86_64-windows-gnu
```

`zig-out/bin/` then has `larpercord.exe` with `SDL3.dll`, `libcurl-x64.dll` and `libcrypto-3-x64.dll`: copy the
four together. Windows needs no fontconfig and no extra fonts: the app takes Segoe UI, Consolas, Georgia and
Segoe UI Emoji from `C:\Windows\Fonts`.

| Command | |

| `tools/membench.sh 60` | measures RAM and CPU for each theme and fails over 60 MB |
| `tools/qa_quadros.py BIN [--slow]` | checks frame skipping and hidden-window memory with a real window in Xvfb |

On Windows, `larpercord.exe` has no console window, so `--help`, `--list-themes`, `--stats` and `--version` print
nothing in a terminal. To see their output, send it to a file (`--version` writes to standard output: use
`-RedirectStandardOutput` for it):

```powershell
Start-Process .\larpercord.exe -ArgumentList '--list-themes' -RedirectStandardError out.txt -Wait; Get-Content out.txt
```

On both systems, options like `--theme` only apply when larperCord isn't running yet: if it's in the tray, a
second start just brings its window back.

## Architecture

```
src/
  core/       plain data, no window: types (snowflakes), Store, markdown, events
  net/        real (Discord) and demo gateways, each on its own thread, plus the queues
  theme/      KDL parser, colors, theme loader, layout engine, manager + file watcher
  ui/         components, rich text, palette, settings, animations
  platform/   window, renderer, "wake the loop"; the only place that knows SDL
themes/       the built-in themes (also compiled into the binary)
third_party/  Dear ImGui 1.93 + dear_bindings (C), with a small patch for bitmap emoji; GNU FriBidi
```

The flow is **UI → `Action` → app → `Command` → gateway → `Event` → Store → UI**.
The UI never changes data directly: it only reads the Store and asks for actions. That's why
swapping the fake gateway for the real one doesn't touch the UI.

## Roadmap

- [x] Real gateway (WebSocket, heartbeat, reconnects) and REST respecting the rate limit
- [x] Session RESUME and zlib-stream
- [x] Presences, members and server/channel events (GUILD_CREATE, CHANNEL_*)
- [x] Images: avatars, attachments and custom emoji with a fixed-size cache
- [x] Per-channel permissions (a padlock on what you can't read), threads and forums
- [x] Windows 10/11
- [x] System tray, signed self-updates and install scripts
- [ ] Native notifications through D-Bus on Linux
- [x] Voice (DAVE/MLS + Opus)
- [x] Calls in DMs and groups
- [x] Rich Presence: show the game you're playing, off by default
- [x] Moderation: kick, ban, timeout, and server mute and deafen
- [x] Bot buttons, menus, forms and slash commands
- [x] Arabic and Hebrew, and fonts for any script
- [ ] A software backend (`wl_shm`, no GPU) to get to about 15–20 MB
- [ ] Theme components written in Lua (sandboxed)

**Next**

- [ ] Open from the saved servers, channels and messages, then sync when Discord answers
- [ ] A texture atlas for avatars and emoji
- [ ] Server and role settings
- [ ] A better theme editor
- [ ] More versatile and more powerful plugins
- [ ] Windows as a single `.exe` (an experimental build option, `-Dsingle-exe=true`, already makes one)
