# Status and roadmap

larperCord is a young project: version 0.6.5, with its first commit on November 2, 2026. It's usable, but it isn't complete.

## What works today

| Area | State | Detail |
|---|---|---|
| Messages, DMs, reactions, replies | **works** | Send, edit, delete, history, mentions, send options, poll voting, who reacted |
| Bots and apps | **works** | Buttons, select menus, forms (modals) and slash commands. App commands in the right-click menu and files in bot forms are missing |
| Images | **works** | Avatars and attachments, with a fixed-size cache |
| Video in chat | **works** | Attachments and direct links. Needs FFmpeg 7, 8 or 9: your distro's on Linux, or the **Download FFmpeg** button in Settings → Chat on Windows |
| Inbox, saved messages, offline search | **works** | All local, can be turned off and erased |
| Multiple accounts, proxy, Lua plugins | **works** | |
| Account settings | **works** | Block, ignore, friend requests, mute and notification levels, status with a duration, custom status, display name, pronouns and About me, synced with your Discord account. The picture and banner, and your own server profiles, are still changed in the official app |
| Server profiles | **works** | Each person's server nickname, picture, bio, pronouns and banner, wherever they appear in that server |
| Moderation | **works** | Kick, ban, timeout, server mute and deafen, the bans list. Only the actions your role allows appear |
| Rich Presence | **works** | Off by default |
| Threads and forums | **works** | Nested threads, forum post lists, creating and editing threads and posts, archived and private ones |
| Custom emoji, stickers, autocomplete | **works** | Animated too. The picker warns when an emoji needs Nitro, and the GIF picker sends stickers |
| Arabic, Hebrew and other scripts | partial | They display in messages and in the message box, and a system font fills in letters any theme lacks. Scripts that need shaping (Devanagari, Bengali, Thai, Khmer…) show their letters one by one, without conjuncts or reordered vowel signs |
| Languages | **works** | English, Portuguese, Japanese and Russian, one translation file each |
| Read state, pins, Discord links | **works** | Synced with your other devices |
| Themes | **works** | 11 built-in, each light and dark, reload on save |
| Voice | partial | Server voice channels and DM and group calls, with the call screen. E2EE (DAVE), the mixer with Remove noise and Even out volume per person, mute, device picker, push-to-talk, high-pass filter, noise gate and RNNoise noise suppression work. On Linux, push-to-talk needs the window focused, and no automated test covers a real call |
| Permissions | partial | Channels without access get a padlock, voice without permission is blocked, and the message box says why you can't send (no permission, a locked thread, a timeout, slowmode). Those channels still appear, and reactions and the member list don't check permissions |
| System tray, updates | **works** | The icon stays in the tray while the app runs and closing keeps it there; signed updates from Settings. On Linux the tray needs a StatusNotifier panel |
| Windows | partial | Windows 10/11 from the same code. Newer than Linux and less used |
| Notifications | partial | Through `notify-send` on Linux and the tray on Windows. Clicking doesn't open the channel |
| Keyboard shortcuts | **works** | The main ones can be changed in Settings → Keybinds, and vim navigation is optional |
| Accessibility | partial | Font scale, interface size, reduced motion, palette and vim navigation. No visible focus and no high contrast |
| First run | partial | Sign-in screen and demo mode, no introduction to the app |
| Platforms | partial | Linux and Windows. The Linux build needs glibc 2.34 or newer. It's used daily on Arch with Hyprland, and opened in Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, openSUSE and Arch containers, in demo mode, before each release. The Windows build has only been run in CI and in a sandbox, in demo mode |
| Joining a server by invite | **works** | From an invite card, a link or a code, with a warning first. Servers with rules or onboarding open them in the app |
| Screen sharing and camera | missing | |

**Next**

- [ ] A texture atlas for avatars and emoji
- [ ] Server and role settings
- [ ] A better theme editor
- [ ] More versatile and more powerful plugins
- [ ] Windows as a single `.exe` (an experimental build option already makes one)

**To make the app complete**

- [ ] Real permissions: hide what you can't see, disable reactions, filter members
- [ ] Shaping for complex scripts (Devanagari, Bengali, Thai, Khmer…)
- [ ] Native D-Bus notifications with "open conversation"
- [ ] Voice: a global push-to-talk on Linux and an automated call test
- [ ] Accessibility and first run: visible focus, high contrast, a welcome screen

**Themes**

- [ ] Engine: overlay and z-order, fonts and images bundled with a theme
- [ ] Gallery and editor: real thumbnails, import and export `.kdl`, a component inspector
- [ ] Theme components written in Lua (sandboxed)

**Later**

- [ ] A software backend (`wl_shm`, no GPU), to get to about 15–20 MB
